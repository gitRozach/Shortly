### Objective

Using JavaScript and React, your challenge is to build out a URL shortening web app, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs), and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

URL shortening is a technique on the Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect that links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "http://example.com/about/index.html" can be shortened to "https://goo.gl/aO3Ssc ".

Your challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   Shorten any valid URL
-   See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
-   Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to along with active states.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **JavaScript** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
